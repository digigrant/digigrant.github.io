	<h1>Hello! My name is Grant Joyner.</h1>
	<p>I'm a student at DigiPen Institute of Technology. I'll be earning my <em>BA in Game Design</em> later this year. <a href="/about">Read more about me here!</a></p>
	<p><strong>This website is still in development, so please take that into consideration!</strong> I am building this portfolio website brick by brick, as a personal challenge to develop my HTML and CSS skills. Your patience is appreciated, and you are welcome to poke around and observe what exists here. <strong>For a more professional display of my portfolio, please go to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gejoyner/">linkedin page</a>. Thank you!</strong></p>

  <h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My full name is Grant Elliott Joyner. My online username is DigiGrant. My <a href="https://wutangclan.net/name-generator/">WuTang name</a> is Beggar Charitable.</p>
  <p>I am a student at DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, WA. I'm currently in my senior year, and I will be graduating this summer/fall! I specialize in level design and gameplay programming.</p>
	
	<h2>Bio</h2>
	
	<p>I grew up in Manchester, MD and graduated from Manchester Valley High School in 2014. After studying at Drexel University for a year and struggling to choose between pursuing Computer Engineering and User Interface Design, I decided to leave the beautiful city of Philadelphia to return home to my family and re-evaluate my goals for higher learning. What I chose was to pursue my lifelong passion of game design, so I journeyed to Redmond, WA and made DigiPen my home.</p>
	
	<p>Since coming to DigiPen, I have made dozens of games across many different forms and genres. Only a select few are showcased here, but they are the projects I feel best illustrate my growth and experience during my adventure. Two of the projects here, Perdition and Being Evelyn, are digital games that were created by a team of very talented people I've come to know under our family name "Contraband". Each project chronicles two to three semesters of hard work, weekly meetings, presentations with professors, and collaboration with generous QA testers. Each of the other projects here is a project where I worked as a solo developer. Please do check them out!</p>

  <h1 class="container-content">About me</h1>
  <div class="container-content">
	  <p>My name is Grant Joyner. My online username is DigiGrant. My <a href="https://wutangclan.net/name-generator/">WuTang name</a> is Beggar Charitable, and I most certainly ain't nothin to fuck with.</p>

  <h2 class="container-content">I am a game designer.</h2>
  <div class="container-content">
    <p>In July 2019, I graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology with a BA in Game Design. I've worked on dozens of games: card games, board games, party games, tabletop RPGs, 2D platformers, side-scrolling shooters, multiplayer co-op and competitive games, simulator games, first-person shooters, and a mobile game. Did you miss my <a href="/">projects</a> page? Those are some of the best ones I've worked on.</p>

  <h2 class="container-content">I am a programmer.</h2>
  <div class="container-content">
    <p>At DigiPen, they (used to) ask designers to take three programming classes to learn basic scripting using ActionScript 3.0 in Flash. That's adorable.</p>
    
    <p>I have 2 years of C++ experience from taking courses outside of my degree program. I've taken courses covering advanced C++ topics, data structures, and algorithm analysis.</p>
    
    <p>The website you're on now is hosted through GitHub Pages and was built with my bare hands, with support from Jekyll. Take a peep for yourself <a href="https://github.com/digigrant/digigrant.github.io">here</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="container-content">I like video games.</h2>
  <div class="container-content">
    <p>Favorite games:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Dark Souls (FromSoftware, 2011)</i></li>
      <li><i>Dragon Ball FighterZ (Arc System Works, 2018)</i> - Not only is this game a dream come true for fans of Dragon Ball, but it's also the most accessible and beginner-friendly fighting game I've ever played. The visuals are stylish and stunning to behold, making it enjoyable to watch even for those foreign to the franchise. I play using a MadCatz SFV Arcade Fight Stick TES+, but I used a regular old DualShock 4 controller for over a year. My team is Janemba / Majin Buu / Kid Buu.</li>
      <li><i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Bandai Namco, Sora Ltd., 2018)</i> - The perfect video game. Over 70 characters. A hundred stages. This is THE ONLY GAME (except maybe Mario Kart 8 Deluxe) you need to bring to a party to get things popping. When you're playing with newcomers, don't be an asshole; leave those items and stage hazards on. Always be prepared to throw down with your main if somebody's asking for it.</li>
      <li><i>The Witness (Thekla Inc., 2016)</i> - I reference this game for its brilliant environmental design and puzzle design constantly. If you're diving into this game for the first time, pay attention to the details and be prepared to take notes. And don't you dare look at a guide for help. It is a must-play for anyone who enjoys long walks on the beach.</li>
      <li><i>The Binding of Isaac (Edmund McMillen, 2012)</i> - I can't recommend this game enough for its elegant and thematic system design, intricate procedural generation system, addicting meta-progression model, and abundance of content, which combine to provide incredible replay value. If you can get past the initial shock of its dark and mature narrative themes, this game will keep you entertained with a plethora of challenges, surprises, and rewards for hundreds of hours.</li>
      <li><i>Pok√©mon FireRed/LeafGreen (Game Freak, 2004)</i></li>
      <li><i>Halo: Reach (Bungie, 2010)</i> - When it comes to first-person shooters, nothing beats the online experience that Reach offered. There was a variety of game modes to enjoy with your friends, from standard Team Slayer to Big Team Battles to Grifball. There was a rich arrangement of gear to unlock and customize your soldier with. And with Forge mode, you could build your own maps and game types to create infinite amounts of fun to enjoy with friends, like the unforgettable Speed Halo. What's not to love?</li>

  <h2 class="container-content">I like music.</h2>
  <div class="container-content">
    <p>For many years of my early life, I was playing percussion in school bands. I participated in my high school marching band for four years, playing marching snare and marching toms. And somehow, I tricked my high school into awarding me with the John Philip Sousa Band Award, a unique honor which recognizes "outstanding achievement and interest in instrumental music". It's an award that symbolizes some of the most meaningful memories of my teenage years and I cherish it almost as much as my BA in Game Design.</p>

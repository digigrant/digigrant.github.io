<p>Perdition is a 3D first-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine 4 for PC. The game features DOOM-inspired fast-paced gameplay with visceral sci-fi combat and an explosive combo system. It was developed by Contraband, a team of 8 DigiPen students including designers, programmers, and an audio engineer.</p>

<p>My role on this project was Level Designer and Release Engineer. I worked with another level designer to create 4 unique 3D levels, each offering about 15-20 mins of gameplay. I was responsible for developing levels from concept, to whitebox, through many iterations, and then handing them off to an artist once they were finalized. I used a variety of tools in UE4 to sculpt landscapes, populate environments with structures and foliage, guide players using lighting and scene composition, choreograph narrative events, and design challenging combat scenarios, all to create environments that push the player forward while encouraging exploration.</p>

<p>Throughout the project, I also set up and facilitated the use of source control for my team. We used Perforce to backup our work and I was responsible for conducting research, installing Perforce and its visual client P4V onto workspaces, and documenting processes and best practices to be used by my team. I was also happy to be the handy-dandy resource for troubleshooting source control issues for my team, and I learned a lot of important do's and don't's along the way.</p>

<p>During the first semester, I worked with another level designer and we each worked on two levels. I gained experience in level pre-production by working with the narrative designer and system designer to make sure each of my levels fulfilled their narrative purpose and introduced new system elements. I also created level whiteboxes by using UE4's editor tools.</p>

<p>In the second semester, my levels were led through several iterations. I added finer detail to the level environments, crafted enemy encounters, and delivered narrative through secret notes and set pieces. Improvements were made based on user playtests, which the team conducted weekly.</p>

<p>Finally, in the third semester, I led all of the levels through the polish phase. The other level designer left the team early in the semester, but before he left, I met with him to do weekly reviews of our levels and record action items for myself in order to ensure that the transition over to a single level designer would be as smooth as possible. During the polish phase, I also worked with the artists on the team to plan out deadlines for each level. Our game shipped with 3 levels that I worked on and polished before passing them to an environment artist for a finishing touch.</p>

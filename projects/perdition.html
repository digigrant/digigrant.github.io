  <h2 class="container-content">Level Designer</h2>
  <div class="container-content">
    <p>I worked with another level designer to create 4 unique 3D levels, each offering about 10-15 mins of gameplay. I was responsible for developing levels from concept, to whitebox, through many iterations, and then handing them off to an artist once they were finalized. I used a variety of tools in UE4 to sculpt landscapes, populate environments with structures and foliage, guide players using lighting and scene composition, choreograph narrative events, and design challenging combat scenarios, and engage players of multiple playstyles to explore and overcome challenges. Finally, I used custom tools made by teammates which empowered my ability to design combat encounters and script objective messages.</p>
    <p>My work as a level designer empowered Perdition by providing...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>three complete and visually-distinct levels (plus one prototype of a level which isn't in the final game)</li>
      <li>thoughtfully-composed environments, which guide the player through the space and teach new gameplay mechanics</li>
      <li>an assortment of combat encounters using a variety of 3D spaces and enemy types to challenge the player</li>
      <li>narrative events through which Perdition can build its world and deliver Beckett's tragic tale against the tinmen</li>
      <li>detailed overhead maps for each level which communicate design intent for other designers and artists</li>
    </ul>
    <!--<p>During the first milestone, I worked with another level designer and we each worked on two levels. I gained experience in level pre-production by working with the narrative designer and system designer to make sure each of my levels fulfilled their narrative purpose and introduced new system elements. I also created level whiteboxes by using UE4's editor tools.</p>
    <p>In the second milestone, my levels were led through several iterations. I added finer detail to the level environments, crafted enemy encounters, and delivered narrative through secret notes and set pieces. Improvements were made based on user playtests, which the team conducted weekly.</p>
    <p>Finally, in the third milestone, I led all of the levels through the polish phase. The other level designer left the team early in the semester, but before he left, I met with him to do weekly reviews of our levels and record action items for myself in order to ensure that the transition over to a single level designer would be as smooth as possible. During the polish phase, I also worked with the artists on the team to plan out deadlines for each level. Our game shipped with 3 levels that I worked on and polished before passing them to an environment artist for a finishing touch.</p>-->

  <h2 class="container-content">Release Engineer</h2>
  <div class="container-content">
    <p>My teammates and I used Perforce to check out files and back-up our work after every work session. I voluntarily conducted research on best practices for Perforce and its visual client P4V, and then I documented those best practices (as well as how-to's for creating workspaces, branches, and checking out/checking in files) to be used by my team. When issues arose, I was happy to provide technical aid to resolve conflicts and get everything sorted out as quickly as possible so nobody was road-blocked for long.</p>
    <p>My work as a release engineer ensured that...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the project was backed up on a daily basis</li>
      <li>team members were informed of what files they could work on and which ones they needed to wait for</li>
      <li>multi-step tasks, like creating a new workspace or branch, were documented to guide team members through them quickly and accurately</li>
      <li>production branches were being merged cleanly for project milestones</li>
      <li>technical issues were being resolved as quickly as possible so the structure remained in an optimal state and team members could get work done when they wanted to</li></p>

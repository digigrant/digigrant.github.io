<p>My role on this project was Level Designer and Release Engineer.</p>

<p>I worked with another level designer to create 4 unique 3D levels, each offering about 15-20 mins of gameplay. I was responsible for developing levels from concept, to whitebox, through many iterations, and then handing them off to an artist once they were finalized. I used a variety of tools in UE4 to sculpt landscapes, populate environments with structures and foliage, guide players using lighting and scene composition, choreograph narrative events, and design challenging combat scenarios, all to create environments that push the player forward while encouraging exploration.</p>

<p>I also set up and facilitated the use of source control for my team. We used Perforce to backup our work and I was responsible for conducting research, installing Perforce and its visual client P4V onto workspaces, and documenting processes and best practices to be used by my team. I was also happy to be the handy-dandy resource for troubleshooting source control issues for my team, and I learned a lot of important do's and don't's along the way.</p>

<p>Perdition is a 3D first-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine 4 for PC. The game features DOOM-inspired fast-paced gameplay with visceral sci-fi combat and an explosive combo system. It was developed by Contraband, a team of 8 DigiPen students including designers, programmers, and an audio engineer.</p>

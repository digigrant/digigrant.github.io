<p>Wolf Bite is a 3D first-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine 4 for PC. The game contains 3 levels, featuring fast-paced gameplay, a three act narrative, and stylized visuals and audio inspired by Hotline Miami and Killer Is Dead. It was a solo project for GAT315, a class focused on crafting an emotional experience through narrative and gameplay.</p>

<p>I was the level designer and narrative designer for Wolf Bite. I used existing systems from Perdition, another project I worked on, for the shooter mechanics. I exercised my skills as an interior level designer by building 3 levels featuring fast gameplay in tight indoor environments. I also grew my skills in Blueprint, UE4's visual scripting language, by creating actors with scripted behaviors and choreographing narrative sequences.</p>

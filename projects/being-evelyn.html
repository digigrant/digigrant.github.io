<p>My role on the team as a technical designer involved creating a hacking puzzle game from a design concept to a fully-polished feature. I built digital prototypes using Unity, created a highly-customizable puzzle generation system using C#, and conducted 12 playtests to gather player feedback. I also prototyped and implemented a pause menu.</p>

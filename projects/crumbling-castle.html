<p>Crumbling Castle is an additional level being developed for Perdition, a first person shooter developed by Contraband. It is being developed independently for GAM450, a senior-level course which I am using to focus on further exercising my level design skills.</p>

<p>For this project, I am the level designer and narrative designer. I am working closely with the professor of the class to research new level design techniques and craft a polished environment that tells an entirely new story. Crumbling Castle introduces a new protagonist in the world of Perdition, many years after the narrative from the original game concluded. Tucker is the last surviving human on the barren remains of Earth, and the invasive force known as the tinmen have collected the resources they wanted and are now leaving the planet. Before the last remaining groups of tinmen leave, Tucker aims to make sure that Earth will not be forgotten after they have left.</p>

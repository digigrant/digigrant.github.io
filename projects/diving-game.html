    <p>My work on this project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio design - sound effects and mixing, use of effects and filters</li>
      <li>Visual design - post processing effects, multiple render passes to create underwater feel</li>
      <li>Controls - choosing an unorthodox control scheme and balancing control curves to evoke clunky-ness of diving suit</li>
    </ul>

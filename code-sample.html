<h1>About the Problem</h1>
<p>This problem focused on what's called a complete graph, wherein every node is expressly connected to every other node. It also works assuming an undirected graph, that relationships are reciprocal.</p>
<p>In social network analysis, you can analyze for structural balance - a configuration wherein you'll find local stability. The easy one is when everyone enjoys a positive relationship with everyone else - they're all friends. Another structurally balanced scenario is when you have - in a graph of three nodes - two friends and each with a shared enemy, so one positive relationship and two negative ones.</p>

<p>With larger graphs, you can continue this analysis by analyzing every three node subgraph and ensuring it has those properties - all positive or one positive and two negative relationsgips.</p>
<p>A structurally balanced graph doesn't indicate complete future stability, just local stability - remember, factions can arise in these networks, akin to the Axis and Allies scenario of WW1 and WW2.</p>
<p>This challenge is to take an input graph and identify if the graph is structurally balanced or not. This has great applicability to social network analysis, and can easily be applied to stuff like fictional universes like the Game of Thrones and the real world based on news events.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, N and M, telling you how many nodes and edges to load, respectively.</p>
<p>The next M lines tell you relationships, positive (friendly, denoted by ++) or negative (foes, denoted by --).</p>

<h1>Writing</h1>

<p>Any good designer needs to be able to write well. Here is a sample of documents I've written that demonstrate my abilities to...</p>
<ul>
  <li>communicate design intentions in a <b>design document</b></li>
  <li>record and organize user feedback in a <b>playtest report</b></li>
  <li>deliver quick key points to a project executive in a <b>status report</b></li>
  <li>explain the mathematical correctness of an algorithm in an <b>empirical analysis</b></li>
  <li>inform team members of source control best practices using <b>step-by-step instructions</b></li>
  <li>engage readers with compelling characters and dialogue in a <b>narrative scene</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Document (GAT212)</h2>

<h2>Playtest Report (GAT250)</h2>
<p>This report organizes feedback from 10 user playtests for my project <a href="/projects/super-dunk-fighters.html">Super Dunk Fighters</a>. The feedback is first organized by the player that gave the feedback (with their permission), and then feedback is re-organized into a summary of action items at the end of the document.</p>

<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>This is a script that I use to test navigation on my portfolio website. It tests all of the clickable hyperlinks and buttons on the site and checks each to make sure they direct the user to the correct location. I wrote the script using Selenium WebDriver and Java. Currently it only performs the tests within Firefox, but I plan to build the script to support more browsers (and more browser versions as well).</p>
